# Lab 3

# Task :

1) Use Retrofit for API requests :heavy_check_mark:

2) Implement more screens  :heavy_check_mark: 

3) Implemented get requests :heavy_check_mark:


# Implementation 
I am doing an online store designed specifically for digital items (instant delivery). Further more, the application will support both: seller and buyer accounts and will allow a seamless transition between the two.

What is currently done.

1) Hard Coded Simple Login Form

2) Feed Form with items for selling

3) Cart Form

4) Landscape mode + support for (hopdefully) most screen sizes.

ADDED:

5) Additional Page for checking your ip (since it is a store app, further work will be done to instruct the user whenether their connection is secure based on ip score.)
