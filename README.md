# Lab 2

# Task :

1) Pick a theme for your app. We will not be allowed to change theme after this lab. :heavy_check_mark:

2) Implement basic UI and layout of your app. Implement design for at least 3 functional screens, this means to create such screen as main home screen, feed or another screen which relates to app business logic.(Created 4 screens: LogIn , Feed , MyProfile , Wish List)  :heavy_check_mark: 

3) At least 1 screen should present collection of data, in other words list of elements. :heavy_check_mark:

4) Create your UI and layout to support portrait and landscape orientations and different screen sizes starting from phone with small screens (4 inch) to tablets with screen size 12 inch.  :heavy_check_mark:

# Implementation 
I am doing an online store designed specifically for digital items (instant delivery). Further more, the application will support both: seller and buyer accounts and will allow a seamless transition between the two.

What is currently done.

1) Hard Coded Simple Login Form

2) Feed Form with items for selling

3) Cart Form

4) Landscape mode + support for (hopdefully) most screen sizes.
